      Hello, I'm Igor Bich</h1>
      <h3>Software engineer</h3>
    <Jumbotron>
      <p> Currently  I am working for TCS as a software developer and have been with the company since 2018.
          I studied computer science at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ)
          where I earned my Bachelorâ€™s of Science degree in computer science.
      </p>
      <p>    
          I am open to opportunities for full time and contract to hire positions in fields related
          to computer science and software development.
          My interests within the realm of computer science are software engineering, web development,
          mobile app development, networks and security, machine learning, and robotics,
          however with the constant changes in technology, I am open to experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am comfortable with any operating system.
          My main languages are Java and Javascript, however I am familiar with many other popular languages.
      </p>
      <p>    
          Outside of computer science I have a variety of hobbies. I enjoy playing guitar, drawing, writing, and working out.
